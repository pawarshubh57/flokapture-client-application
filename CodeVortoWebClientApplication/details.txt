Reviewing email can be an incredibly effective cure for insomnia, but don’t snooze through common problems often revealed in emails: 
Undisclosed client complaints
Insider trading or selective disclosure
Distribution of marketing materials not conforming to the Advisers Act, the rules promulgated thereunder, or applicable no-action letters (e.g., Clover Capital)
Promissory claims or guarantory performance language
Suspicious emails from clients who may have had their email account hacked
Undisclosed matters requiring disclosure on an advisor’s U4
Breaches of non-public personal information or failure to follow privacy policies
Failure to place the client’s best interests first or other fiduciary failings
